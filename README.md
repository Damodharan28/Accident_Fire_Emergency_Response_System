# Accident and Fire Detection and Response System #

Accident and Fire Detection and Response System is an automated solution designed to enhance emergency response efficiency. Utilizing YOLOv8, the system detects accidents and fires in real-time, assesses severity, identifies involved vehicles, and optimizes hospital notifications. By integrating advanced algorithms such as the Haversine Distance Algorithm and leveraging GoMapsPro API for location services, the system ensures efficient resource allocation. Notifications are sent via Twilio API, and responder acknowledgments are managed using a webhook. Incident data, including detected frames, is securely stored using MongoDB and Google Drive API. This project aims to minimize response times and improve emergency handling through automation and real-time decision-making.
